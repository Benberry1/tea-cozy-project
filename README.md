# Tea Cozy Project

This project is part of my [Codecademy full-stack learning path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path). This is a basic HTML & CSS single page website and the task was to recreate the given design brief, images were also provided. The issue I found with this project was that there was no allowance for responsive design. I adjusted the design brief to allow for mobile first responsive design, used responsive units such as rem where necessary, and adjusted some areas to improve appearance.

I started completing the Codecademy full stack learning path to cement knowledge gained in my current web development course and although it starts with basic tasks it has so far been great for revision.

Areas I was able to revise:

- CSS grid
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile first responsive design
- General CSS/HTML implementation

## Installation
